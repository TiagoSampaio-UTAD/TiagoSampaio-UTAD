# 🚀 About Me

Hello! I am **Tiago Sampaio**, a Software Engineering student at the University of Trás-os-Montes and Alto Douro (UTAD). I have a great passion for programming and even developed the banner I use myself, using HTML and CSS, reflecting my passion for transforming logic into functional visual interfaces.

* 🎓 **Software Engineering**: Focused on algorithms, system architecture, and robust development.
* 💻 **Tech Stack**: Special interest in low-level languages (such as C) and modern Web technologies.
* ⚙️ **Philosophy**: I believe that "Loading..." is just the temporary state before an innovative solution.
